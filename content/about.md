## About this site
This is a site to preserve all the charts I've made and subscribed. The "mobile" charts are my own, and the "phoenix" charts are sourced from a radio station located in Denpasar, Bali.

## Behind the scenes
This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and [Mainroad](https://github.com/vimux/mainroad) theme. Learn more on Hugo in [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). Complete documentation is available at
[Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).
